Convene
=======

Who you are, what you do, and what you’re going to give them
Lay out your agenda (give, give, give)
Do not want to say “I want, I want, I want"
“Hi my name is Louis, how are you doing today?”
Friendly, upbeat opening statement and rapport building.

#### Rapport statements:

    "It sure is getting warm in Seattle, is it heating down in Portland as well?"
    "I was on your website and you guys do some amazing work.  I especially like the university residence halls."
    "It looks like we have a common connection in Matthew Konecky.  He actually advises our multi-billion dollar corporate endowment.  How did you guys meet?"
    "It looks like we both attended Penn State and both studied engineering.  What engineering did you study?”
    "I just sent you a connection on LinkedIn."
    "I’m doing well, and thank you for asking.  I got to the gym this morning and did one of those [bootcamps | spin classes] and it really took the wind out of me.  Have you ever tried one of those classes?"
    "I know you guys are located in downtown Portland.  I was just there with my wife and we found an amazing sandwich shop just around the corner from [PIMCO], have you gotten a chance to try them out yet?"
    "I’m actually new to Seattle, but have already found some of my favorite neighborhoods.  How long have you been in Seattle?"
    "I saw that your company had recently launched new product X.  That is no easy task, but have you guys seen some good early traction?"
    "I’m with a company that recently launched in the PNW and it looks like your company is also in its first year.  I hope you guys have achieved some early wins!  How has this first year been for you guys?"

"Hey, I know you’re busy, the reason for the call today is…"

1. To introduce Cloud Obsidian as a resource to build software for companies similar to Matthew’s Motorcycles.
2. Share with you a few solutions that we’ve been able to successfully delivery to other companies of your size.
3. Discuss some ideas that can help streamline your business.

"But before I go into all of that, [_take in question_]"

#### Avoid:

* “product": use "solution" or "idea"
* "Glad I caught you"
* Referring to working out; it's self-serving and potential landmine ("I missing a leg").
